# Examples of security analysis reports

This folder includes two detailed contract analysis reports and two simplified contract analysis reports. From these two report types, we can know *the details of VulHunter's 31 security detectors*. Note that the difference between simplified and detailed is that the results of the detectors outputting secure are not displayed in the simplified  report. That is, the simplified reports mainly focuses on briefing the contracts' problems, thereby reducing the time for auditors to read the reports. Nonetheless, vulnerabilities that do not exist in contracts illustrated in the detailed reports can alert owners to develop the contracts with specifications in the future.

The file "0xf3122a43ee86214e04b255ba78c980c43d0073e2_Revolution__2_report_opcodes.pdf" is a detailed contract analysis report for contract *Revolution\_\_2* in Dataset_3. It includes five parts: summary information (e.g., contract name and audit time), contract audit results (e.g., vulnerability distribution and 31 of detectors' results), contract code (e.g., audit input and extracted instances), and contract audit details (i.e., the detailed results of 31 detectors, containing the vulnerable instances and the repair policy for contracts' vulnerabilities). 

## 0xf3122a43ee86214e04b255ba78c980c43d0073e2_Revolution__2_report_bytecodes.pdf

The file "0xf3122a43ee86214e04b255ba78c980c43d0073e2_Revolution__2_report_bytecodes.pdf" is also a detailed contract analysis report for contract *Revolution\_\_2*. The difference between it and the above file is that the vulnerable instances in this file are bytecode sequences.

## 0xf3122a43ee86214e04b255ba78c980c43d0073e2_Revolution__2_main_report_opcodes.pdf

The file "0xf3122a43ee86214e04b255ba78c980c43d0073e2_Revolution__2_main_report_opcodes.pdf" is a simplified contract analysis report for contract *Revolution\_\_2*. Its contents are similar to the file "0xf3122a43ee86214e04b255ba78c980c43d0073e2\_Revolution\_\_2_report_opcodes.pdf", except that it does not describe the recommendations of the detectors that output secure.

## 0xf3122a43ee86214e04b255ba78c980c43d0073e2_Revolution__2_main_report_bytecodes.pdf

The file "0xf3122a43ee86214e04b255ba78c980c43d0073e2_Revolution__2_main_report_bytecodes.pdf" is also a simplified contract analysis report for contract *Revolution\_\_2*. The difference between it and the above file is that the vulnerable instances in this file are bytecode sequences.
