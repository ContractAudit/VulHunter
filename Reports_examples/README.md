# Examples of security analysis reports

This folder includes a detailed contract analysis report and a simplified contract analysis report. From these two reports, we can know *the details of VulHunter's 31 security detectors*. Note that the difference between streamlined and detailed is that the results of the detectors outputting secure are not displayed in the streamlined report. That is, the streamlined report mainly focuses on briefing the contracts' problems, thereby reducing the time for auditors to read the reports. Nonetheless, vulnerabilities that do not exist in contracts illustrated in the detailed report can alert owners to develop the contracts with specifications in the future.

The file "0xf3122a43ee86214e04b255ba78c980c43d0073e2_Revolution\_\_2_report.pdf" is a detailed contract analysis report for contract *Revolution\_\_2* in Dataset_3. It includes five parts: summary information (e.g., contract name and audit time), contract audit results (e.g., vulnerability distribution and 31 of detectors' results), contract code (e.g., audit input and extracted instances), and contract audit details (i.e., the detailed results of 31 detectors, containing the vulnerable instances and the repair policy for contracts' vulnerabilities).

The file "0xf3122a43ee86214e04b255ba78c980c43d0073e2_Revolution__2_main_report.pdf" is a simplified contract analysis report for contract *Revolution\_\_2*. Its contents are similar to the above file, except that it does not describe the recommendations of the detectors that output secure.
